Web design tools and techniques are always growing and changing. There are forums with constant debate on what is what, what is best, and why they have their ideas to support their case. It may seem nice to work with computers and sit down all day but it's no easy task when learning is part of the process.

It's nearly impossible to fully understand how everything works in computers, websites, and programs. To be a writer of these takes serious skill and understanding. Again, methods and strategys change almost every day and the industry is constantly evolving.

Right when you think you have grasped a concept there will always be another way to look at things and another approach to getting the same outcome in coding. It will always be a grind to stay in the game.

It is important to stay well informed and enforce good coding techniques. Always keep an open mind and try to figure out the best solution with minimal clutter.

Here are some sources that I follow to keep me in the loop with things that are always changing in the land of coding:

//idea 1
//idea 2
//idea 3
//idea 4
//idea 5

Make sure to always fully research something and never just believe it the first time. Try to see if there is a counter-argument or evidence supporting the information. 

There seems to be a lot of trolls on the internet trying to give the wrong information so always do your best to fully research, and this goes for everything in life!
