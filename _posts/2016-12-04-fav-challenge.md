title: My favorite challenge learning to develop
---

The biggest challenge I've faced learning to develop with BLOC has been learning and writing javaScript and jQuery code. Exploring new concepts I have never experienced was tough but eventually I was able to understand more and more how functions work.

I never could understand how websites and programs would write function properties like clicking a button or displaying an animation. When I started to see how they were coded and how they worked, I felt relief and understanding right away.

Even just as simple as seeing a play button turn into a pause button is cool to see come to life after you coded everything that makes it exist. Functions within javaScript and jQuery are the most complex logic to me. 

When I got halfway through writing code for BLOCJAMS, a basic music player, I was getting more and more happy each time I saw a function come to life. Sometimes they would be diffifuclt to write or understand. 

I learned the most from meeting with my mentor who would help me understand logic better and better each time we met. It always felt good to show him how I could understand what he was explaining to me or be able to demonstrate a concept. 

I like having separate files for scripts and css files within a webpage. It's nice to have things spread out and be able to pick and choose what you want to edit. 

Overall, learning javaScript and jQuery was the funnest thing I've learned in the program. The relief is overwhelming and the impossible seems possible each time you write another code.
