Whether you are a newbie or professional, chances are that some of these points will help you to bring your front-end development career to the next level.
Here are 8 tips to help you become a better front-end developer:

## Step 1. PLAN YOUR PROJECTS

The first mistake most developers make is not making a plan. Sometimes it feels boring and we don't feel it's important. That's why we skip this crucial step quite often.

Good planning helps you:
Save time
Reduce stress
Comfortably finish on time
Not complicated

Simply putting down a list of templates and elements which need to be converted from PSD to HTML or breaking up any complex elements into smaller parts and writing them down is enough.

Make simple project to-do lists which help:
Stay organised
Keep head clear and focus
Identify roadblocks early in the project phase
Easily keep client, boss or project manager in the loop

Helpful tools for planning:
### Workflowy - dump a list of templates into a Workflowy bullet list
### Writemaps - create a website map
### Trello - create a project board and cards for each of your templates and elements
### Pen and Paper - all of the above in an old fashioned but still effective way

Planning is important, but not always everything goes as carefully planned.

## Step 2. BE PROACTIVE

Proactively highlighting any roadblocks or delays is a very powerful way to keep everyone happy. It's ok if things are taking longer than initially planned, but it's not ok to keeping this for yourself.
You're stacked with a bug or can't figure something out? You're not alone, everyone deals with issues on almost every project.

When this happens, call it out!

Everyone will appreciate you trying your best and keeping them in the loop with the progress of the project.

Write a short summary of what you did today and what you will working on tomorrow, highlighting any concerns so that your boss and or client will remain happy within the process.

Other reasons to be proactive:

It makes you look more professional
It boosts your credibility
It helps to build a trust

Setting a daily or weekly reminder will help you to never forget to give a project progress update.

Helpful tools for reminders:

### Google Calendar - create a simple recurring event
### Evernote - create a note with a checklist of your tasks and set a reminder
### iOS Reminders

## Step 3. BE CURIOUS

New tools, plugins, techniques and languages are being released almost every day. It is very important that you stay open to all the new things and will make an effort to explore and understand them. The bad and at the same time the beauty of front-end development is that it's moving forward very fast. This means that you can quickly become an expert but also your skills can become very quickly outdated.

You don't need to know everything, just having a rough overview about a topic or technique is fine. You can then dive deeper into it when the right project comes along.

### HTML5 Weekly
### JavaScript Weekly
### Responsive Design Weekly
### Sidebar.io
### Web Design Weekly

## Step 4. INVEST IN YOUR SKILLS

You will need to invest in yourself in order to grow. I don't mean spending money on expensive courses, seminars or books, I am more thinking about investing your time. There is no short-cut to success and researches show that it takes around 10000 hours to master a skill, that's around 4 years practicing 40 hours a week. Be prepared to put up with late nights exploring other websites, experimenting with new plugins and frameworks, reading web development blogs, listening to podcasts and chewing through thousands of tweets.

Schedule a time for self-development into your week. I know this might be harder if your employer doesn't support you, but be prepared to invest some of your free time into your own career.

Helpful blogs and podcasts for front-end developers:
### CSS Tricks
### Codrops
### ShopTalk Podcast
### Boagworld Podcast
### Apply Filters Podcast

## Step 5. DON'T SAY YES TO EVERYTHING

Clients and bosses are demanding, we all know that. But saying yes to everything can eventually turn against you and you will end up working for less, being under the pump and stressed out. Carefully evaluate what are the projects requirements and align that with your skills. Also be sure to ask which browsers you need to support. There is nothing wrong in highlighting which parts of the project will need a senior assistance or will need to be left out of the project scope. Highlighting these earlier in the project timeline will make the whole process from start to finish much smoother for everyone.

Don't be afriad to call out functionality or feature which is out of your skill set. Being honest is the key, but also make sure you don't say no to everything.

## Step 6. DON'T SAY NO TO EVERYTHING

Contradictory to the previous point, but also important attribute of a highly effective front-end developer is learning something new on every project. Each project is a great way to implement a feature which you are not familiar with or you do something new for the first time. By saying no to everything and only doing the things you are familiar with, you are essentially closing the doors for personal and career development.

Exploring the unknown will give you a great feeling of achievement, satisfaction and will keep you hungry to learn new things again and again.

Pick a feature, plugin or a technique you wanted to use for some time and implement it in your next project.

## Step 7. FIND A MENTOR:

You are keen to learn, but not sure where to start? What shuold you learn next? How to implement this or that?

Find someone with more experience that you, someone who is keen to help you to grow. Your mentor should be someone who you respect, someone who you would like to be like. Someone who can teach you how to code and what to avoid doing. This could be your boss, your colleague or someone online who you will follow. Bigger companies might have a formal mentorship program in place, but if you are in a small studio or on your own, look on the internet. Following developers like CHRIS COYIER, PAUL IRISH or getting a mentor through THINKFUL or similar programs might be a good idea.

A good mentor will help you:
Get advice on your project approach
Get a sense of direction
Help you foresee any potential rodeblocks

Remember a mentor is not a guy who will do everything instead of you and is not there to motivate you. You still need to be curious and self-motivated in order to grow. 

## Step 8. STAY ACTIVE

Working in the digital industry means that we spend a lot of time staring at the computer screen. Sitting 40-60 hours in the office will sooner or later take it's toll. That's why it's vitally important that you look after your body the same way as you take care of keeping your markup nicely organised and commenting everything you do. Healthy body and healthy mind means better code. So when you schedule your week, don't forget to include some non digital activities - walk, run, gym or whatever else will make you forget about all the pixels around you.

Watching YouTube or TV is not an escape from the tech world and won't make you feel refreshed. Anything that gets your blood pumping will.
