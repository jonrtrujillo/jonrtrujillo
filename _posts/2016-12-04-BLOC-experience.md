I have always been interseted in how webpages and programs work. I finally have taken the time to look deeper into how they exist.
I found BLOC through research on the internet to learn and pursue a job in the web develop and program field online while working my current job. 

I've learned a few things along my path to learning developer skills. I have used HTML, CSS, Command Line, Github, Javascript, HTML5 and jQuery to create simple web content. I have created a basic music player that has a player bar and list of songs to scroll through. My understanding for how coding makes up what we see and do on the internet is improving every day.

BLOC has easy directions for each checkpoint in the program. However sometimes it will require doing a little more research than what they teach you. The point is that you learn to research things on your own passed your knowledge. I've learned in the program that web design is always changing and things are always evolving. So you must be ready to learn new content and keep moving with the advancement of the industry.

BLOC has straight forward examples of how things work. I can always go back and reinforce what I've learned before. I can even use their guidelines to start my own projects. It's nice to be able view a timeline of the assignments I've completed.

BLOC uses a strategy to help students learn the content as best as possible while online. They asign each student with a mentor who fully understands the content and then some. Students meet with their mentor online each week to have meetings about their status in the program. I personaly have learned the most in this program just by talking to my mentor. It's because they understand the content so well that it makes very clear sense to be when I hear them explain it. It's hard to read new content on your own without anyone telling you that you're doing it right. Having a mentor is the best learning tool in the program.

I hope to complete the program and move on into a new career that will better my life and let me do something that I like more than what I'm doing now. The battle will always be constant, I know that there will still be work to do and deadlines to meet the same as it is now. The difference is now I'll be doing something I like not worry so much about my future.
