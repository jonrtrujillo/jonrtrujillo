## Blocjams begin

I created Blocjams while attending Bloc to become a web developer. Blocjams is an online music player similar to Spotify and Pandora. 

## What I wanted to do

I wanted to create a website that would play music, store album information and have a song player bar. With properly working functionality and easy to read material.

## What I did

The code making up the website originally used a lot of Javascript to create all the functionality so I simplified it by using jQuery. The long list of code was shortened and repetitive code was minimized.

## What I got

Blocjams now ran the same way but with less code, overall making me happy to see my music website come to life.

It was then I realiezed upon further research that jQuery could actually take longer to load and run slower than Javascript.

I ended up sticking with jQuery because Blocjams doesn't have an overload of code making it up.

## Final Thoughts / Lesson

Blocjams is a cool online music player that uses jQuery to support it's functionality. The biggest thing I learned during this project is that the kind of code that makes a websites functionality can vary. It all depends on how much is happening on the page and how much is in the code. Javascript and jQuery have plenty of pros and cons, to pick one it all depends on what you're trying to build.
